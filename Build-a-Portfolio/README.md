<h1>About</h1>

<p>This is my submission for Project P2: Build a Portfolio, part of Udacity's Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.</p>

<h3>Technologies</h3>
I have used several technologies in this project in order to help my workflow. I've outlined these technologies here
<ul>

<li>Grunt</li>
<p>The Grunt ecosystem is huge and it's growing every day. With literally hundreds of plugins to choose from, you can use Grunt to automate just about anything with a minimum of effort. If someone hasn't already built what you need, authoring and publishing your own Grunt plugin to npm is a breeze.</p>

<p>You can refer it from <a href="https://gruntjs.com/getting-started">here</a></p>

<li>Bootstrap</li>
<p>Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.</p>
